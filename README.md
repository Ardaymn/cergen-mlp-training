# cergen-mlp-training
Train MLP on MNIST with my CerGen tensor library. No NumPy or PyTorch used.

# CerGen MLP: Training a Neural Network from Scratch

This is my solution for the second take-home exam (THE2) of CENG403: Deep Learning.  
It extends the CerGen tensor library to build and train a simple MLP on MNIST using only Python.
